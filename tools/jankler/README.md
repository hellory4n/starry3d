# Jankler™

Jankler (Janky Blender) is a voxel modeller that exports to [Starryvox](../../docs/format_starryvox.md).
Why not just use MagicaVoxel? I was gonna make a converter from `.vox` to Starryvox but it seems there's not
a single library to load `.vox` files in the entire observable universe (other than some random repo i found
last updated 9 years ago that would be legally questionable to take because there was no license), so this is
the next best thing.

WARNING: This code is, to put it lightly, shit.
