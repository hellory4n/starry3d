# Janklerâ„¢

Jankler (Janky Blender) is a voxel modeller that exports to [Starryvox](../../docs/format_starryvox.md).
Why not just use MagicaVoxel? I was gonna make a converter from `.vox` to Starryvox but it seems there's not
a single library to do so in the entire observable universe, so this is the next best thing.
