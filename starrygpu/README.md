## fucking

Conveniently every Zig binding for a graphics API seems to have some curious issue that breaks everything, so this is written in C and then used through a thin Zig wrapper.

Supported backends are Direct3D11 and Vulkan. Direct3D11 is intended as more of a sanity check (since it's not cross platform)
