## fucking

Conveniently every Zig binding for a graphics API seems to have some curious issue that breaks everything, so this is written in C and then used through a Zig wrapper. This is probably dumb and stupid.

Currently the only supported backend is OpenGL 4.5. I'd like to support Vulkan eventually but it wears me out.
