CompileFlags:
  # so it includes those as <...> instead of "..."
  # this is important so clang-format can format the headers and stuff
  Add: [-isystem, thirdparty, -isystem, thirdparty/libtrippin, -isystem, thirdparty/imgui]
  # sometimes submodules have their own compile_commands.json/compile_flags.txt
  # by sometimes i mean just rgfw
  # only rgfw does that
  # why
