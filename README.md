## FAQ

### Have you tried \[game engine] you fucking moron

No fuck off.

### Why?

Voxel rendering can be quite the pickle, so I think it's easier and better to just do the whole thing
from scratch. Also why not also the suffering is endless

### Is this stable enough to use?

No.

### Where's the documentation?

Can't be bothered to write real documentation when the engine changes every picosecond.

### Why Zig?

I like Zig.
