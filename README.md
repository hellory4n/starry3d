## FAQ

### Have you tried \[game engine] you fucking moron

No fuck off.

### Why?

Voxel rendering can be quite the pickle, so I think it's easier and better to just do the whole thing
from scratch. Also why not also the suffering is endless

### Why C++? Can't you be a normal human being and use Rust Go Zig Odin Nim Sip Cliff Swig Beef (this one is real) Swag S'mores?

No fuck off.
