## FAQ

### Have you tried [game engine] you fucking moron

No fuck off.

### Why?

Turns out raylib is giving me esoteric memory issues and it doesn't help that it intentionally avoids
checks for esoteric memory issues. I would rather make my own graphics framework than debug that. Quite the
pickle.
